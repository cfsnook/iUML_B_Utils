The iUML-B diagrams generate Event-B which is annotated as generated.
The generated Event-B is read-only and editors (should) not allow you to edit it.
You can however, add manually entered elements to the Event-B machine alongside the generated ones.
The intention is to allow users both options: modelling by diagram, modelling in Event-B.

As well as generating new Event-B elements, iUML-B often \emph{elaborates} existing Event-B elements.
In the latter case, the iUML-B model element contributes to the definition or children of the elaborated element.
For example, an invariant could be generated to constrain the elaborated element.
